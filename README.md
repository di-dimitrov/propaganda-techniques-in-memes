## This is a fork of [Facebook's MMF framework](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf).

## Data
The data is located in the `/data/.` directory. 
The path to the labels is: `./data/datasets/propaganda/defaults/annotations/` and to the images: `data/datasets/propaganda/defaults/images/`

## Running the code

#### !!! Please make sure that CUDA 10.2+ is installed on you machine.
#### !!! Linux OS is recommended, otherwise you would face installation problems.
#### !!! We are using the open source Multimodal Framework developed by FacebookResearch: https://mmf.sh/

### Follow these steps to get all the code ready and running:
1. Prerequisites - generating image caption features for VisualBERT and ViLBERT:
    1. Install MMF according to the instructions here: https://mmf.readthedocs.io/en/website/notes/installation.html
    2. Install the following packages: `pip install yacs, opencv-python, cython` (if using 'pip', any package manager works)
    3. Clone vqa-maskrcnn-benchmark repository: https://gitlab.com/vedanuj/vqa-maskrcnn-benchmark
        1. Run `python setup.py build`
        2. Run `python setup.py develop`
        3. Run the feature extraction script from the following path: 'mmf/tools/scripts/features/extract_features_vmb.py'
        4. After feature extraction is done convert the features to a .mdb file with the following script: 'mmf/tools/scripts/features/extract_features_vmb.py'
        5. Rename the .mdb features file to 'deceptron.lmdb' and move it to '/root/.cache/torch/mmf/data/datasets/propaganda/defaults/features/'
2. Running the models - open **'Propaganda_Detection.ipynb'** and **run** the code inside.
